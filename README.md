# PLP Week 1 HTML Assignment

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Power Learn Project's Week 1 HTML Assignment. The goal was to build a single-page website using only HTML5, focusing on semantic structure, accessibility, and basic SEO principles.

## Features
* **Semantic HTML5:** Utilizes elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc., to structure content meaningfully.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Incorporates `lang` attribute, `alt` text for images (though placeholder in this version), `label` for form inputs, and a logical heading hierarchy to improve usability for assistive technologies.
* **Basic SEO:** Includes a descriptive `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<meta name="keywords">`, and a `canonical` link for search engine understanding.
* **No CSS or JavaScript:** The website is built entirely with HTML to demonstrate foundational structuring capabilities.
